Hi, everyone.👋

About me 👀

I am a frontend developer with a substantial background in telecommunications. I hold degrees in Computerized Technologies and Systems of Publishing and Printing Production, as well as an MBA.

I develop products using the JavaScript React library and NodeJS. For deployment, I use Debian 10 and 11. I am a Linux enthusiast, and I am continuously excited to improve my development skills, vision, mindset, and solutions.

The road will be overcome by the one who walks it. Here we go 🏃
